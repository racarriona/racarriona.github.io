				<h2><strong>HYPERCORRECTION</strong></h2>
				<h3><em><u>What is it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>The hypercorrection effect is a memory effect that makes us memorize our errors. For example, if in a French exam you get a word wrong, there is a higher chance that you will remember it more than the words you got right. </p>
				<h3><em><u>Why does it work?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Since our confidence is affected, and we are surprised by our errors, we remember the error better since there is a strong emotion associated with the memory of the mistake and its solution.</p>
				<h3><em><u>How can I use it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>To use it in your studying, you should learn the content, do a test and identify your weak areas to work in. </p>

				<h2><strong>SPACING</strong></h2>
				<h3><em><u>What is it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Spacing methods refer to revising the information you wish to study in short intervals over a period of time. Instead of studying two hours the day before your exam, study 20 minutes every day the week before.</p>
				<h3><em><u>Why does it work?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Recalling often little information and gradual learning instead of cramming a lot of information in one moment is shown to be better for retention. Some people were even able to remember something they studied 8 years ago with this method!</p>
				<h3><em><u>How can I use it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>The most popular method is to use flashcards and revise them according to how much do you remember over time. However, you can also schedule subject or topic specific study sessions spaced in progressively bigger intervals.</p>
				<p>Anki is a flashcard software that categorizes your flashcards, prioritizing what you have to work on. Google Sheets or Excel are also great to organize your study sessions for this method. </p>

				<h2><strong>INTERLEAVING</strong></h2>
				<h3><em><u>What is it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Interleaving is the practise of shuffling the topics you are studying within the same subject. For example, instead of practising sums for one hour, you do 15 minutes of sums, 15 minutes of subtractions, 15 minutes of multiplication and 15 minutes of divisions. </p>
				<h3><em><u>Why does it work?</u></em></h3>
				<p>It is very effective for studying for tests as it develops more skills that might connect and ease problem resolution. </p>
				<h3><em><u>How can I use it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>This is a very simple method, as you only need to organize your time and choose your practice material wisely. Give every topic a few minutes and change to others within the subject, to then repeat. It is also advised to mix the topics. </p>

				<h2><strong>ACTIVE RECALL</strong></h2>
				<h3><em><u>What is it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Active recall refers to a set of study methods that require retrieving information from memory rather than consuming it.</p>
				<h3><em><u>Why does it work?</u></em></h3>
				<p>This ensures learning as it is an active technique. It strains on your brain and needs neural connections to work together, effort that will be remembered by the brain, and cause you to remember that information better.</p>
				<h3><em><u>How can I use it?</u></em></h3>
				<p>Any study method that requires recalling information can be called an active recall method. For example, generating questions from the content and answering them without help of any material, or practice exercises.</p>
				<p>These two strategies find support in modern technology, as you can ask ChatGPT to design questions and exercises based on your learning style, study goal and education program. </p>
